        <h1>Interest</h1>
        <p>
            Transitioning into the tech space has always being quiet interesting. I started my career as a salesperson and moved into customer service. I was able to create a career path for myself up to being a country manager.<br> I relocated out of Nigeria to somewhere in Europe and discovered that the only option for me to get a well paid job with work from home option is to switch into the Tech space. I decided to join Altschool Africa to have a clear career path in IT. Joining Altschool is really worth it as I have learnt a lot within the short period of resumption.<br>
